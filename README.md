# Coding-Noughts-and-Crosses-in-Python
Python code for a game of Noughts and Crosses (Tic-tac-toe)

## Introduction
This Jupyter Notebook includes the Python code for a text-based game of Noughts and Crosses (Tic-tac-toe). The code was developed as a milestone project for the [2021 Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/).

## Implementation
The game is played using the numeric keypad as a map of the 3 x 3 noughts and crosses grid.
- A coin toss begins the game; the winner of the toss chooses their preferred symbol (X or O)
- Players place their mark using the numeric key corresponding with their chosen position on the grid
- Ensure that **Num Lock** is enabled to allow use of the numeric keypad!

## Dependencies
Python 3.8
